# Personal-Endava-Challenge

Welcome to Personal Endava Challenge, Readers Nest Project has:

* 3 Microservices using Spring Boot (Users, Books, Bookclubs) 
* 2 Databases MongoDB and MySQL
* Graphql Server for process microservices REST API
* Jenkinsfile for CI/CD and deploy to AWS
* docker-compose file to deploy in localhost


## Prerrequisites
* JDK 1.8
* Maven
* Docker

## Run in localhost

1. Enter to each microservice and run 

```
cd readers-nest-backend/bookclubs
./mvnw clean package
```
In **Linux** maybe you have to change permissons for the mvnw file in each microservice 

```
sudo chmod +x mvnw
```

If you have maven in path variable you can execute outside the folder

```
readers-nest-backend/bookclubs/mvn clean package
```

Those commands will create a target folder with .jar file that contains all code ready for deploy in docker container

2. Run the command

```
docker-compose up -d
```

If you need to change configurations files or code in the services you must run

```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This in order to create images and containers again, but be carefull. You will lose data from databases

3. Test the complete project through localhost:3000

4. Enjoy

## Warning

* Token Auth just has 5 minutes for work, If you spend more time, you have to do a login again in the front end in order to refresh token.
* In Docker Toolbox you have to change ip address from React project in index.js file. Use "docker-machine-ip":4000 instead localhost:4000

## Notes

* Microservices were made with IntelliJ and Spring Boot Framework 
* Project work in Docker for windows 17.12 and Docker Toolbox. Docker for windows 18.03 and latest version for Linux doesn't work and we don't know why
